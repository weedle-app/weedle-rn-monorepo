**Weedle Web3 React Native SDKs** is a collection of modules/tools that make developing Dapps on mobile for iOS and Android super easy and quick. The modules contain some of the common use cases you will encounter from auth with wallets, to communicating with contracts and so much more. The aim is to build a lightweight set of SDK's that will make development fast, easy and intuitive so you can just focus on giving the best experience to your customers.

## Packages

The SDK's are split into multiple modules so you can just grab what you need without taking up unecessary space on your users device. The only compulsory package that MUST be installed is the core/app module, which has config and some other utilities that all other packages need.
